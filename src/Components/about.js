            <p>Who is Ishwarya?</p>
            <div>
                <p>My name is Ishwarya Hidkimath Basavaraj, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science with a solid background in Software Development, boasting 4.5 years of industry experience.</p>
                <p>I have worked at Ribbon Communications, a prominent telecom firm. Our focus was centered on ensuring "the six nines" assurance in our routers and policy servers. As a dedicated software engineer, I played a pivotal role within the core team, contributing to product development and programming while continuously striving for optimal code efficiency. I have been part of a major pivot of the software that is from migration from monolithic architecture to Microservices. I am proud and happy to say that I have worked on their billing system, license management to convert it to a fully-fledged Microservice. Having been proficient in Java, shell scripting, multi-threading, distributed systems, AWS, OpenStack, PostgresQL, Github, Kubernetes, I moved to the metadata firm to expand my horizon.</p>
                <p>After working for 3 years in a networking firm where I earned all the experience related to software development, I could see how OTT is taking over the world, especially during and after the pandemic, and I made my move to a metadata company called Xperi (formerly known as Tivo) as a senior software engineer. Even though I was in charge of managing their data foundry Microservices, I was interacting with the data providers' team. Their work on collecting all the metadata about the programs through various forms like wiki, video clips, subtitles, synopsis, etc., fascinated me the most. I couldn't resist digging deep into this, and I realized how important it is to know about data and extract the right information from it. I participated in a hackathon and made a small project on predicting the content genre based on the content plot available on Wikipedia. This profound curiosity ultimately prompted me to pursue a master's degree, with the aim of delving deeper into data mining, web mining, processing large data, machine learning, etc.</p>
                <p>I am hardworking, and deeply passionate about the work I do.  As part of my masters I have completed courses like Data Mining, Statistical Machine Learning, Semantic Web Mining, Data processing at Scale and software Verification and Validation Testing.</p>
